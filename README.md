**The code and graphs provided are part of the manuscript entitled: "High-throughput characterization of the role of non-B DNA motifs on promoter function"**

This repository and its constituent sub-folders contain the scripts and tables for the generation of figures for this manuscript.

The file Promoter_figures.nb.html contains the code and vizualizations for the majority of the analyses in the manuscript.

The folder MPRA_scripts contains scripts used for the identification of non-B DNA motifs in the MPRA experiment.

The folder simulations contains scripts for the generation of germline variant controls.

The folder GO contains the table with the gene promoters and the Non-B DNA motifs found as well as the genes found associated with each Non-B DNA motif.

The folder Heatmaps_bubble contains the tables with the enrichments and p-values used for the generation of the graphs for the distribution of Non-B DNA motifs in regulatory elements.

The folder Volcano contains the tables with the relative expression difference and p-value for Non-B DNA motifs and Transcription Factors.

The folder TSS contains the single base-pair resolution of the occurrences of each Non-B DNA motif.

The folder Nucleotide_resolution_plots contains scripts the mutational enrichment of Non-B DNA motifs relative to different mutation categories.
